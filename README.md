## Cog [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thatguystone/cog.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/thatguystone/cog)

Cog is a collection of utils for golang that I tend to use across many of my projects. Rather than building new cogs everywhere, I've just consolidated them all here. Cogs for everyone!

### Modules

Cog consists of the following modules:
